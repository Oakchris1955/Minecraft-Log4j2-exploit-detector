# Minecraft Log4j2 exploit detector

 This python tool can detect if your computer is infected with the Log4j2 MC exploit

## Setup

 Firstly, you need Python. Anything above 3.6 version should be fine. Then open a `cmd` prompt, `cd` to where you saved the repo and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Windows or `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` for Linux

## Usage

Place it on your desktop and just run it. It will check the current user for the exploit

### FAQ

#### Q) What if I don't have Minecraft?

##### A) In that case, your user will just appear non-infected. That's because the way program works, if it doesn't find the `AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/logs/` subfolder, it won't check for anything and it will appear like nothing is there
